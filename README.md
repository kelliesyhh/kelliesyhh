I am a PhD student in the [Information Systems Technology and Design](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg) pillar at the [Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)](https://sutd.edu.sg). I graduated from SUTD with a Bachelor of Engineering (Computer Science and Design). My area of interest is Human-AI Interaction and Mental Health.

I am always looking to use my engineering and technological skills to serve others in medical and healthcare settings. 

I am passionate about making a difference and I desire to combine my knowledge and technology to serve others.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about full-stack development, UI/UX design, and machine learning. I'm hoping to learn more about Human-Computer Interaction in the coming months too.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always keen to collaborate or bounce ideas on anything mental health related, or anything that involves using technology in medical or healthcare settings.
